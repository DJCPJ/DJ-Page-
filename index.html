				<h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
			
		    <div class="parallax">
				<p>  My earliest memories are dancing to the sound of disco in the late 70’s with my mom in our apartment in upstate New York.  ‘Ring My Bell’ by Anita Ward, “Le Freak” by Chic, and “Bad Girls” by Donna Summer filled the air.  My mother loved music and transferred that love to me.  
				</p>
				 <p>In the early 80’s Stevie Wonder, Quincy Jones and Earth Wind and Fire dominate the turntable in our home.  By the mid 80’s I was old enough to listen to my own music and I followed to of the biggest stars of all time Michael Jackson and then Prince.  I even had the red “Beat It” jacket. 
				</p> 
	  
				<p>In the mid 80's I started taping a new genre of music off the radio, it was called Hip-Hop.  “Friends” by Whodini and “Jam on It” made my first mix tape.  I had taped copies of "I’m Bad" by LL Cool J and "Raising Hell" by Run DMC.  By the end of the decade Hip-Hop had started to dominate my tape player and when Straight Out Of Compton came out it blew my mind.  As young bi-racial man in small town that was predominately white it gave me a wider connection to African diaspora. 
				</p>
	  
				<p>Form me the early 90’s was a mix of Gangata Rap and New Jack Swing.  When there was a high school dance our party at the skating rink I couldn’t wait to do the running man to Bel Biv Devoe or Bobby Brown and Jodeci is not only my favorite R&B group of all time but also the first concert I ever attended.  
				</p>
	  
				<p>All through the 90’s my musical taste stayed consistent but around 2000 my younger brother starting going to raves and he introduced me to house music and as they say the rest is history.  House was something that grew slowly for me, but when I moved to the Bay Area in 2007 it exploded.  Brothers and Sisters at Luka’s in Oakland and The People’s Party at the Oasis introduced me to the true culture and love that is house music.  
				</p>
	  
				<p>While those parties sparked my passion Odie Kim and Flo-Ology taught me the culture and dance of the house scene.  That education peaked at Second Sunday one week.  I was dancing with some fellow students who took the Flo-Ology class from Odie and Ten.  That party was cool, but definitely had a pretentious element.  I remember looking at everyone and saying you know what parties should be “About the Music” and the concept was born.  
				</p>
	  
				<p>About the Music is an amalgamation of these past experiences and my contribution to the culture that has given me so much.  As a community based music collective I am glad I have helped build a space that brings people so much joy and I am grateful to everyone who attends our events and contributes to the positive atmosphere.  Moreover,  I would be remiss if I did not mention my crew mates Eric Grove and Jayson Kincaid and thank them for taking my concept and growing it into what is today.
